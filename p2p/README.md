## P2P network demo:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9727b29a-abb2-4619-ac01-2d8acd9b0bb5

## üì¶ Project Components

### 1. **IPFS Utilities (`/ipfs/mcache.py`)**

- Provides an interface to **Pinata‚Äôs IPFS API**.
- Allows uploading files or strings to IPFS.
- Supports fetching content from IPFS by CID.
- Includes tests to verify upload and retrieval logic.

### 2. **P2P Networking (`/p2p/runner.py` & `/p2p/coordinator.py`)**

- Uses **py-libp2p** to spin up a peer-to-peer node.
- Supports:
  - Connecting to other peers.
  - Subscribing/publishing to pubsub topics.
  - Running an interactive CLI for managing connections and training sessions.
- Includes bootstrap node logic for maintaining mesh summaries.

### 3. **Logging (`logs.py`)**

- Uses [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for pretty, structured logging.
- Provides clear runtime logs for peer connections, pubsub events, and mesh updates.

### 4. **Testing (`/tests`)**

- Uses `pytest` for unit and integration tests.
- Currently focused on IPFS functionality and basic P2P messaging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/P2P-Federated-Learning.git
cd P2P-Federated-Learning
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file at the project root with your Pinata credentials in reference with
the `.env.example` file

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
JWT_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_here
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

We use make targets for reproducibility.

```bash
make repo
.venv/bin/activate
```

#### üß™ Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

To run a specific test (example: IPFS client upload/fetch):

```bash
pytest tests/test_mcache.py::test_upload_string_and_fetch
```

#### üöÄ Running the P2P Node

To start the interactive P2P runner:

```bash
python p2p/runner.py
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to configure the node role (bootstrap, client, or trainer).
Once running, the CLI provides commands such as:

```bash
Available commands:
- connect <multiaddr>       - Connect to another peer
- train <topic>             - Start a training round in the fed-learn mesh
- join <topic>              - Subscribe to a topic
- leave <topic>             - Unsubscribe to a topic
- publish <topic> <message> - Publish a message
- topics                    - List of subscribed topics
- mesh                      - Get the local mesh summary
- bootmesh                  - Get the bootstrap mesh summary
- peers                     - List connected peers
- local                     - List local multiaddr
- help                      - List the existing commands
- exit                      - Shut down
```

## ‚úÖ Current Progress
